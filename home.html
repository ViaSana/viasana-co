            <h4> Wisdom's Way </h4>
            <p> Built for a holistic health and life coach. Through deep collaboration, we gained insight into her brand vision, target audience, and desired user experience. We brought her unique approach to mind-body wellness to life through intentional design choices and custom content. The site exudes an airy, wholistic aesthetic while also clearly communicating the coach's offerings. Lead generation elements like an email and contact forms enable visitors to easily engage further. This holistic coaching site exemplifies our process of fusing creative design with digital strategy to craft experiences that aesthetically and functionally achieve business goals.</p>

            <h4> Zen Yoga Studio </h4>
            <p> This yoga studio website we developed as a portfolio project. While fabricated, it demonstrates our skills in strategizing, designing, and building custom sites optimized for specific client needs. For this yoga studio, we crafted a clean, modern website focused on providing schedule and membership information while reflecting the brand's zen, mindfulness-based culture. Thoughtful UX choices, responsive design, and purpose-built content came together to engage visitors. Though conceptual, projects like this yoga site showcase our process for collaborating with clients to bring their brand to life online through tailored web experiences.</p>
